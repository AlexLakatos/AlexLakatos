![AVOCADO DAYS](https://alexlakatos.com/img/posts/avocados/avocado-days.png)

I suppose this is the part where I get to talk about myself like I don't do that enough already. Fair warning, if asked, I will talk more about these:

- 👨‍💻 I'm Alex, but most of the internet knows me as "Laka". I've [passed 30](https://twitter.com/avolakatos/status/1197492397673811968), and I did collect 200$.
- 🏨 ~~I occasionally tell people I live in London. That's a lie! In fact, I rent a prohibitively tiny and expensive studio apartment in London, but I live mostly out of airports and train stations. My first home is LGW🛩!~~
- 🏄‍♂️After traveling around Asia for 9 months and living out of a suitcase in hotels and AirBnBs, I've moved to Bristol just before the pandemic hit. Because they have an artificial surf pool here.
- 🙊 I've spoken at several conferences in-between working in ~~the UK~~ an airport lounge, such as OSCON, FOSDEM, MozFest, and others.
- 🥑 I'm the ~~JavaScript Developer Advocate~~ ~~Developer Relations Manager~~ Technology Lead at the [Interledger Foundation](https://interledger.org/). That means I used to code for a living, then just talked and wrote about coding for a living, but now I mostly spend my life in meetings, listening to others talking about coding for a living.
- 📰 [Julia](https://twitter.com/iza_biro) and I curate the [Developer Avocados Weekly](https://developeravocados.net/) newsletter every Monday, for people who want to become (better) Developer Avocados.
- 🤪 I've built some silly things along the way, like [puns.dev](https://puns.dev/).
- 🦊 I like to volunteer, and I've been doing so for Mozilla since Firefox 4. I'm currently a [Mozilla Reps Mentor](https://reps.mozilla.org) and a now-defunct [Mozilla Tech Speaker](https://twitter.com/mozTechSpeakers).
- 📜 I've done JavaScript for the last 11 years, so don't be surprised if most of my example code is written in JavaScript. I'm not quite the one-trick-pony I let people believe, I've been known to write Rust, Python, .Net, C, PHP and even Java(I'm not particularly proud of this one).
- 🐥 I've recently joined the W3C, and I'm an editor for the [Web Monetization](https://webmonetization.org/) standard. [DM me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/avolakatos) if you want some free coupon codes to try it out.
- 💡 If you haven't figured it out by now, I'm sarcastic AF, and self-irony is not entirely unknown to me.

## Twitter

If you want to [follow me on twitter](https://twitter.com/avolakatos), I feel like we should set some ground rules, so here it goes:

- ✋ Tweets are mine and mine alone. Please don't take your frustrations towards me out on some other poor soul.
- 🎭 I use twitter for myself and sometimes my work. This means you'll see things about the places I speak at, the blog posts I write or find exciting and a bunch of stuff about my personal life.
- 🙋‍♂️ I also use twitter to ask for help, so you'll see me asking about how to fix that damn CSS layout at 2am.
- 📬 I have open DMs if you need help with Web Monetization, JavaScript, or <a href= "https://twitter.com/avolakatos/status/1037227109180231681">how to build your own T-shirt blanket</a>, feel free to DM me. I'll also feel free to not respond if it's inappropriate. Deal? Deal.
- 🏁 I live-tweet some of the talks I find interesting at the events I go to, threaded.
- 😳 I'm more than happy to apologize if I made a mess of things, so feel free to DM me and point that out.


As you've probably figured out by now, it's all a bit random. [This tweet](https://twitter.com/avolakatos/status/1014307113370374145) best sums up my twitter interactions. If you're cool with all this, then we can be Twitter friends. If not, we can be Linkedin friends. Maybe.
