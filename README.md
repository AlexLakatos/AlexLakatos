I suppose this is the part where I get to talk about myself like I don't do that enough already. Fair warning, if asked, I will talk more about these:

- 👨‍💻 I'm Alex, but most of the internet knows me as "Laka". I've [passed 30](https://twitter.com/lakatos88/status/1197492397673811968), and I did collect 200$.
- 🏨 ~~I occasionally tell people I live in London. That's a lie! In fact, I rent a prohibitively tiny and expensive studio apartment in London, but I live mostly out of airports and train stations. My first home is LGW🛩!~~
- 🏄‍♂️After traveling around Asia for 9 months and living out of a suitcase in hotels and AirBnBs, I've moved to Bristol just before the pandemic hit. Because they have an artificial surf pool here.
- 🙊 I've spoken at several conferences in-between working in ~~the UK~~ an airport lounge, such as OSCON, FOSDEM, MozFest, and others.
- 🥑 I'm a ~~JavaScript~~ Developer ~~Advocate~~ ~~Relations~~ Avocado 🥑 Manager at [Fidel API](https://fidel.uk/dos). That means I used to code for a living, but now I mostly just talk and write about coding for a living.
- 📰 [Julia](https://twitter.com/iza_biro) and I curate the [Developer Avocados Weekly](https://developeravocados.net/) newsletter every Monday, for people who want to become (better) Developer Avocados.
- 🤪 I've built some silly things along the way, like [puns.dev](https://puns.dev/).
- 🦊 I like to volunteer, and I've been doing so for Mozilla since Firefox 4. I'm currently a [Mozilla Tech Speaker](https://twitter.com/mozTechSpeakers) and a [Mozilla Reps Mentor](http://reps.mozilla.org).
- 📜 I've done JavaScript for the last 10 years, so don't be surprised if most of my example code is written in JavaScript. I'm not quite the one-trick-pony I let people believe, I've been known to write Rust, Python, .Net, C, PHP and even Java(I'm not particularly proud of this one).
- 💡 If you haven't figured it out by now, I'm sarcastic AF, and self-irony is not entirely unknown to me.

## Twitter

If you want to [follow me on twitter](https://twitter.com/lakatos88), I feel like we should set some ground rules, so here it goes:

- ✋ Tweets are mine and mine alone. Please don't take your frustrations towards me out on some other poor soul.
- 🎭 I use twitter for myself and sometimes my work. This means you'll see things about the places I speak at, the blog posts I write or find exciting and a bunch of stuff about my personal life.
- 🙋‍♂️ I also use twitter to ask for help, so you'll see me asking about how to fix that damn CSS layout at 2am.
- 📬 I have open DMs if you need help with public speaking, JavaScript, or <a href= "https://twitter.com/lakatos88/status/1037227109180231681">how to build your own T-shirt blanket</a>, feel free to DM me. I'll also feel free to not respond if it's inappropriate. Deal? Deal.
- 🏁 I live-tweet some of the talks I find interesting at the events I go to, threaded.
- 😳 I'm more than happy to apologize if I made a mess of things, so feel free to DM me and point that out.


As you've probably figured out by now, it's all a bit random. [This tweet](https://twitter.com/lakatos88/status/1014307113370374145) best sums up my twitter interactions. If you're cool with all this, then we can be Twitter friends. If not, we can be Linkedin friends. Maybe.
